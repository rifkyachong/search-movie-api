what makes me want to do it anyway?
Well, probably, this is not the problem of ambition in the first place. Because, of course, I want to become a softwaredeveloper. This is the problem about fear and unwillingness. Why it takes this long to admit my fear. I cover it with price for a long time. I waste my time in it.
